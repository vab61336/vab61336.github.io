                <p> My name is Victoria Brunner (the one on the right). When I was younger, I <span style="font-style:italic;"> really really really really </span> wanted to be a stand-up comedian. 
                But everybody laughed at me. I'm finally doing what I always wanted to do, but nobody's laughing now. </p>
                <p>    In the words of my little brother, <q> Nobody laughs when I try to make them, but everybody laughs at me when I'm 
                just doing my thing. </q> He's crazy. We all are. If you look up, you'll see a picture of me and two of my brothers looking
                pretty cool. This is not how we usually look. To see how we usually look,<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk"> Check out my blog! </a> </p>
                
                <p> There are a lot of bad jokes on this page - brace yourself for another one! My family loves Far Side Comics, and <b> here is one of our favorites:

				<p> Let me tell you a little bit more about my family. I have 2 wonderful parents, 6 brothers, and 2 freaky dogs (they're just weird). 
				I always thought having so many siblings was relatively normal, but when I tell people that, 
				they usually act really surprised and ask if they heard me right. I say yes. So now, I'm starting to get the idea that maybe it isn't so normal. 
                Here's a chart to answer questions about my brothers that I get asked the most. </p> <br>

				Since we're talking about some random favorites, like favorite noodles, I'd like to include a soundclip of my favorite 
				Disney song. Try to guess what it is before you listen! Here are some hints:
							
				<ul>
					<li> It was written in 1991 </li>
					<li> It was originally performed by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra</li>
					<li> Erich Kunzel is the original voice of Gaston </li>
					<li> Beauty and the Beast was the Disney movie that was released in 1991 </li>
					<li> The lyrics mention expectorating, a few dozen eggs, and inspire me to use antlers in all of my decorating </li>
				</ul>

                <p class = "one"> Hey! You're still here! <br> And after I played that cruel trick on you.I'm sorry, the Gaston song is copyrighted. Look it up on youtube if you want to hear the real 
				thing, but copyright-free music is still pretty cool, right?! <br> If you just cant get enough of these shenanigans, you should <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk"> Check out my blog! </a> 
                Anyway. Since you're still here, I guess I'll tell you another story. Once, in 8th grade, I was messing around in science. Great start, right? 
                No, I didn't "have chemistry" with some boy. Hahahaha. <br> No. <br> But I <span style="font-style:italic;"> was </span>very attracted to this hole puncher. 
                And I tried to hole punch my hair. So I ended up giving myself a trim with a hole puncher. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Cool story bro. And speaking of hole punchers, 
				it was recently the 131st birthday of the hole puncher! Get off this webpage and go celebrate! </p>
